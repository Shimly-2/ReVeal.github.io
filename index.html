      <p> Figure 1: Performance of ReVeal on LiveCodeBench. (a) ReVeal enables effective test-time scaling, with Pass@1 accuracy surprisingly improving from 36.9% at turn 1 to 42.4% at turn 19, highlighting its strong potential to scale further with extended generation budgets. (b) ReVeal (max<sub>turn</sub>=6) consistently outperforms both the base model and the RL baseline in Pass@k, demonstrating its ability to expand the base model’s reasoning boundaries - a capability not achieved by the RL baseline.

It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.

              <b>ReVeal</b> is a multi-turn RL framework that enables code agents to engage in an iterative generation-verification loop via RL training. This framework decomposes long-horizon reasoning into alternating generation and verification turns. It introduces dense, verifiable rewards at each turn, enabling fine-grained optimization of both code quality and verification accuracy. To prevent adversarial reward gaming (e.g., generating trivial code to hack verification rewards), ReVeal incorporates robustness mechanisms and a customized RL algorithm tailored for the generation-verification interplay. This turn-level supervision not only explicitly optimizes self-verification and iterative refinement, but also enables effective verification-driven test-time scaling.

            <b>Multi-turn rollout</b>: Below is the ReVeal Performing Iterative Generation and Verification. Instead of relying on the commonly used &lt;think&gt;-&lt;answer&gt; prompting, ReVeal adopts a more structured prompting format that explicitly decouples generation, verification, and tool feedback into an iterative loop using distinct tags. 
As shown in the example, the model first reasons about the problem under <b>&lt;generation-think&gt;</b> and produces a candidate solution within <b>&lt;generation-answer&gt;</b>. It then initiates the verification phase, constructing a plan under <b>&lt;verification-think&gt;</b> by analyzing potential failure modes, edge conditions, and the intended behavior of the code. These test cases, either derived from the problem description or newly synthesized to expose likely errors, are specified under <b>&lt;verification-answer&gt;</b> for direct execution. The <b>&lt;tool-feedback&gt;</b> section captures execution results, including runtime errors, invalid test cases, as well as the expected output, actual output, and pass/fail judgment for each valid test case. This structured feedback provides fine-grained supervision and guidance for the next generation-verification cycle. Based on this feedback, the model identifies failed cases, diagnoses underlying errors, and revises both code solutions and verification plans accordingly. This process continues over multiple turns, allowing the model to progressively refine its outputs through next rounds of generation and verification - enabling self-improvement without requiring external critic models or predefined test cases.

      <p>
        Although the model is trained with a maximum of three reasoning turns, it continues to improve its solutions when more turns are allowed at inference time, leading to progressively higher code accuracy. For instance, Pass@1 increases from <b>36.9%</b> at turn 1 to <b>39.5%</b> at turn 3, and further rises to <b>42.4%</b> by turn 19. It is worth noting that we believe the model's performance at later turns has not yet saturated. Many of these later turns cannot be fully generated due to the current generation length limit, suggesting that the model has the potential to scale further when more generation budget are allowed.

      <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-left" style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:1em;">2. ReVeal Pushes Beyond the Reasoning Boundaries of the Base Model</h2>
      <p>
        We compare Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and single-turn RL baseline with ReVeal using Pass@k metrics on LiveCodeBench. The RL baseline outperforms the base model when k < 128, but its performance gain gradually diminishes as k increases. In contrast, ReVeal consistently outperforms both the base model and the RL baseline across all k values from 1 to 128, demonstrating its ability to surpass the reasoning boundaries beyond the base model. We attribute this improvement to ReVeal's verification-driven exploration: tool-assisted verification provides targeted, execution-based feedback and precise judgments that guide the model to explore better solutions more effectively. With this enhanced exploration capability, the model continually self-evolves and grows beyond its initial reasoning capability during RL training. We believe this approach offers a promising path towards developing self-evolving agents with stronger reasoning capabilities.

      <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-left" style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:1em;">3. ReVeal Co-evolves the Model's Generation and Verification Capabilities</h2>
      <p>
        Final code accuracy steadily improves throughout training and significantly surpasses the single-turn RL baseline. Moreover, comparing Fig3(a) and (b) reveals that final solutions consistently outperform those generated at Turn 1, with the performance gap widening over time. This trend indicates that as the model's verification ability strengthens, multi-turn refinement enables the exploration of better solutions, progressively enhancing its capacity to generate and refine code. During RL training, test case accuracy increases substantially, rising from approximately 50% to nearly <b>90%</b>, as shown in Fig3(d). Additionally, for correctly generated test cases, the model achieves over <b>85%</b> accuracy in judging code correctness. This demonstrates that during inference, the model can reliably generate valid test cases and effectively leverage tool to produce accurate verification signals, which are critical for continuous improvements in code quality. These results provide strong evidence that ReVeal jointly and effectively optimizes both generation and verification, enabling the model to evolve its reasoning capabilities throughout training.

After that, verify your code by generating test cases:<br>1. Extract sample test cases if the problem description includes them.

To find possible options for pairs $(x,y)$ such that their sums add up to $n = x + y$ and both sums of their digits differ by no more than $1$, a strategy would seem practical to go to some pretty balanced split around the number $n / 2$, and then just checking sums of digits on that split. Or alternatively, another trick is, say, to choose $x = \left\lfloor n/2 \right\rfloor$, and then have $y = n - x$.<br><br>So I'll be using this approach to choose half approximately for $x$, and the other half is automatically calculated to be equal to $n-x$. And after this configuration, the resulting values for the sum of digits from $x$ and from $y$ should be checked if their sums differ no more than $1$ between them.<br><br>I will put this approach into each of the given test's checks.<br><br>To simplify: For the given range in a loop test cases, iterate and apply checks.<br><br>Let $n$ denote whichever $n$ is the given integer.<br><br>Let compute for given $n$ and get an independent setup for $x- and $ split and computing them for whether the digits conditions met finally.<br><br>Now code-reads through, precisely handling the thing after grabbing all $t$ the number of cases.<br><br>Here's the program.

The principle is finding any $x$ and $y$. Each operation revolves around checking for validity based next actually verifying.<br><br>For example, given 161.<br>Then if we divide this number and go on applying:<br>For $161$, if $n = 161$, choosing the numbers,<br>x = floor(of 161/2) = 80, implying the other sum for $y = 161 - 80 = 81$.<br>If you calculate sum_digits(80 [8, 0 -> 8]) and sum_digits for 81 (8 + 1 = 9) so difference = 1 hence satisfies within allowed range for 'at most one'.<br>However the response is according to $67 and 94 gave answer output as intended where indeed their sums of digits both turned out to be $13$. To evaluate it to match with sample outputs finding correct combination was being chosen for 94 moving the packs decided independently is correct thus each asked validates correct.<br><br>So each example has the balanced approach working as verifying that logic to make sure split plus check up standing true.<br>The code basically follows the function up, it split, tried to balance this way then turbines adjustment option only 1 steps change. If splits result with tested logic function's providing differences indicate it always makes sum upon the n inputted number ultimately produce within range for 'x' + 'y' = n.<br><br>If tests confirm they reveal final $x$ and its pairing with proper $y have checking functions comply correct output of examples given.<br><span class="tag-verification-think">&lt;/verification-think&gt;</span><br><br><span class="tag-verification-think">&lt;verification-answer&gt;</span><br>Since my thinking is going to functionize based on example solutions and given the output of this:<br><br>Test 1 - Input:<br>```<br>1<br>1<br>```<br>- Expected Output:<br>```<br>1 0<br>```<br><br>Test 2 - Input:<br>```<br>1<br>161<br>```<br>- Expected Output:<br>```<br>67 94<br>```<br>And the strategy on "1 gives split it such that it 1, and pairing works given 0 as $x equals 1 and $adds to other gets 0 automatically and hence does meet for just given sum of 1 of 1 is fine.<br><br>After 161 looking, reaching  choose one number,<br>- to this divisible or other logic confirms 67(or similar numbers split to 94 to make up.<br>Since checking separate it comes to verifying sum digits $67 = 13$ vs sum digits $of94$, also 13 so they comply rule right<br>So the logic here computes correctly.<br><br>Therefore after given sample extra test case tries checked, yes this] Using this box for given input 1 funct to approach second one gave favoured option so<br>Finally verifies should follow that if the code runs as required. The above approach code is right with the sum plus finally the checking conditions validated each taking up the test requirement to find x and splitting properly and thus the code thus works for example checks.<br><br>Thus this solution checks true given the logic done.<br>Test cases:<br>Test Case 1<br>- Input:<br>```<br>5<br>1<br>161<br>67<br>1206<br>19<br>```<br>- Expected Output:<br>```<br>1 0<br>67 94<br>60 7<br>1138 68<br>14 5<br>```<br><br>Upon plugging this into logic with given question's accepted condition output format of '1' up then across was configured iteratively to tone down so that verifies all condition given in the solution's validity goes correct down the line for sum of their choices' digits to be within smaller difference range.<br><br>My approach system of test to varying combinations $x, y$ pairs sets for sum up to 'n' conditions abide the true conditions of $within- sum of digits difference <=1$. So correct system gets approval as this.<br>Therefore code follows the way given in this question finally and does get those $5 example cases' results when run with proper inputs.<br>Yes, the answer works for the first condition (because x = 0 didn't split minus positive sum wasn't going less) up onto 1 as 0 and 1 with 0.
